RUBY                                            *ruby.vim* *ruby-syntax*

There are a few options to the Ruby syntax highlighting.

By default, the "end" keyword is colorized according to the opening statement
of the block it closes. While useful, this feature can be expensive: if you
experience slow redrawing (or you are on a terminal with poor color support)
you may want to turn it off by defining the "ruby_no_expensive" variable: >
        :let ruby_no_expensive = 1
In this case the same color will be used for all control keywords.
                        
If you do want this feature enabled, but notice highlighting errors while
scrolling backwards, which are fixed when redrawing with CTRL-L, try setting
the "ruby_minlines" variable to a value larger than 50: >
        :let ruby_minlines = 100
Ideally, this value should be a number of lines large enough to embrace your
largest class or module.

Finally, if you do not like to see too many color items around, you can define
"ruby_no_identifiers": >                                
        :let ruby_no_identifiers = 1
This will prevent highlighting of special identifiers like "ConstantName",
"$global_var", "@@class_var", "@instance_var", "| iterator |", and ":symbol".
